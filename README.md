## Description

#### As a fictitious employee at Pewlett Hackard. I was tasked with a research project on employees of the corporation from the 1980s and 1990s. All that remains of the database of employees from that period are six CSV files. In this homework I will design tables to hold data in the CSVs, import the CSVs into a SQL database, and answer questions about the data. 


### Graphs and Tables:

#### - Details of each employee: employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary.

#### - First name, last name, and hire date for employees who were hired in 1986.

#### - The manager of each department: department number, department name, the manager's employee number, last name, first name.

#### -  Listing the department of each employee with the following information: employee number, last name, first name, and department name.

#### - Listing first name, last name, and sex for employees whose first name is "Hercules" and last names begin with "B."

#### - All employees in the Sales department, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.

#### - All employees in the Sales and Development departments, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.

#### - The frequency count of employee last names (i.e., how many employees share each last name) in descending order.

#### - A histogram of the most common salary ranges for the employees

#### - A bar chart for the average salary by title


### - Challenges 

#### - Importing data correctly when creating primary and Foreign keys 
#### - Merging the data with inner joins with common primary keys 
#### - Importing sqllite into pandas
